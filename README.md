First bigger Cpp project, the idea was to create command-line based text game. The topic is Ancient Rome.
Project was developed for fun and to learn some object mechanisns like Polymorphism and Abstracion. 
Written in Visual Studio that's why some files are "different" and unnecessary like "stdafx.h"  

Game.cpp & Game.h are the "hearth" of the game and action starts from there
 Hopes for some tips if same1 would be interested in it :) !
